    <p>I enjoy coding and design. I currently work at Spiceworks where I surround myself with very talented people to develop digital advertising experiences for companies like Microsoft, Lenovo, and HP. I use mostly front-end web technology to create these experiences as well as design tools and a little bit of back-end elbow grease to polish everything off.</p>
    <p>I enjoy helping my local community using the skills that I have. This includes the Budget in a Box application for the City of Austin and context notes for Austin EcoNetwork. I also think it's important to give back to the tech community. I've presented on exciting tools like design patterns and <a href="http://cuyaproductions.github.io/sass-color-functions/presentation/#/" target="_blank">Sass color functions</a> at Spiceworks and to groups like Sass ATX and Open Austin.</p>
    <p>In my time off, when I'm not coding away on a personal or volunteer project, you'll often find me hiking or exploring delicious food around Austin, TX.</p>
